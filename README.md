# Ethnicity-Project
It is a simple and basic program which help you identify your ethnicity using web camera. For this project I have used Python with OpenCV, Google_Image_Download, OS and Keras(Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)). With help of Google_Image_Download we downloaded and saved different ethnicity images into .jpg files which were then cropped for faces by OpenCV and face cascade. Then the images were fed to a basic Convolutional Neural Network Architecture and then trained to give prediction on live webcam input.
